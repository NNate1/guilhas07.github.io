Hi! I'm **Guilherme Soares** and welcome to my website! Here is where I'm going to explore
my current hobbies such as coding projects, [self-hosting](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)>) and [Capture-The-Flag security challenges](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)>). Hope you enjoy it!

### About Me:

- I have a Masters Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (Portugal), where I specialized
  in Cyber Security and Distributed Systems.

- Cyber Security topics are really fascinating to me, so I like to explore
  that passion by solving CTF challenges and writing about them, to further deepen my understanding.

- My editor of choice is [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (_I use neovim btw_)
- I love to contribute to Open Source. Currently I mainly contribute to the Neovim ecosystem but I'm
  always open to broaden my horizons to other projects!
