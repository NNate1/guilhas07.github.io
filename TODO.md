maybe convert website title to image (svg??) - [ ]
reduce sidebar height so it doesn't scroll - [ ]

render with minify to remove html comments - [ ]

For the Navigation Bar, here are a few ideas on what to include:
Home

Links to your homepage with a brief introduction (as discussed in your previous request).
About

A page that expands on your professional journey, interests in backend development, any relevant tech skills, and a mention of your CTF hobby.
Projects

Showcasing your backend projects (if any), any full-stack or personal coding projects youâ€™ve worked on. This could include GitHub links, descriptions, and technologies used.
CTF Writeups (or Blog)

If you regularly write blog posts or publish CTF writeups, this can be a dedicated section. You could also merge this into a Tech Blog section that includes CTF writeups alongside other topics you explore (backend tips, tutorials, etc.).
Resume

Include a downloadable PDF or an online interactive version of your resume to make it easy for potential employers to see your qualifications.
Contact

A simple contact form or links to email/social media where people can reach out for professional inquiries.
Final Thoughts:
For the website title, consider combining your primary focus (backend development) with your personal interest in CTFs and learning journey. The key is to strike a balance between presenting yourself as a serious candidate for general tech roles and showcasing your unique passions, like security.
